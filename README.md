# Grokking Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my code practices based on the concepts covered in the "Grokking Algorithms" book by Aditya Y. Bhargava. 

## About the Book

"Grokking Algorithms" is a beginner-friendly book that explains complex algorithms and data structures in a simple and understandable manner. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Introduction to algorithms
- Selection sort
- Recursion
- Quicksort
- Hash tables
- Breadth-first search
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Dynamic programming
- And much more!

## Practices

In this repository, you will find my implementations of various algorithms and data structures discussed in the book. Each implementation is accompanied by detailed comments explaining the logic and approach used.

## Table of Contents
